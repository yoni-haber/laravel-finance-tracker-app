# Bank Statement Upload

Users upload CSV files exported from their bank or credit card provider. The system parses them asynchronously, stages the transactions for review, deduplicates against existing data, and commits them to the transaction history only after explicit user confirmation.

## Import Lifecycle

```
uploaded → parsing → parsed → committed
                  ↘ failed
```

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `uploaded` | File stored, job queued |
| `parsing` | Worker is processing the CSV |
| `parsed` | Staged transactions ready for review |
| `failed` | Processing failed (retries exhausted) |
| `committed` | User confirmed; real transactions created |

## Data Model

### `bank_profiles`
User-owned configuration that tells the parser how to read a specific bank's CSV format.

- `config` (JSON) — 0-based column indices for `date`, `description`, and either `amount` or `debit`/`credit`; also stores `date_format` and `has_header`
- `statement_type` — `bank` (positive = income) or `credit_card` (positive = expense)

> The UI presents 1-based column numbers; the model converts to 0-based on save.

### `bank_statement_imports`
Tracks one upload operation end-to-end.

- `status` — current lifecycle state
- `bank_profile_id` — which profile to parse with
- `statement_type` — copied from the profile at upload time

### `imported_transactions`
Staging table. Records live here until the user commits the import, then real `Transaction` rows are created.

Key columns: `hash`, `original_hash`, `is_duplicate`, `is_committed`, `category_id` (nullable, no FK).

- **`hash`** — updated if the user edits a transaction's description/amount/date on the review page
- **`original_hash`** — set at parse time from the raw CSV data; never changed. Used as `Transaction.hash` on commit so re-uploading the same file is always detected as a duplicate.

## Key Classes

| Class | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `BankProfileManager` | Livewire CRUD for bank profiles |
| `StatementImportManager` | File upload, job dispatch, status polling |
| `StatementImportReview` | Review UI: edit, categorise, commit |
| `ParseBankStatementJob` | Queue job — 3 retries, 60s timeout |
| `BankStatementImportProcessor` | Orchestrates parse → stage pipeline |
| `CsvFileReader` | Reads raw CSV rows via `SplFileObject` |
| `TransactionRowParser` | Maps a CSV row to a transaction array using the bank profile |
| `DuplicateDetector` | Generates hashes and checks for duplicates |
| `StatementImportCommitter` | Creates `Transaction` records and marks the import committed |

## End-to-End Flow

1. User selects a CSV and a bank profile on `/statements/import`.
2. `StatementImportManager::uploadStatement()` stores the file as `statements/{import_id}.csv`, creates a `BankStatementImport` record, and dispatches `ParseBankStatementJob`.
3. The job atomically claims the import (`uploaded`/`parsing` → `parsing`) to prevent duplicate processing, then delegates to `BankStatementImportProcessor`.
4. The processor reads the CSV, parses each row via `TransactionRowParser`, runs `DuplicateDetector::detectDuplicates()`, and bulk-inserts results into `imported_transactions`. Both `hash` and `original_hash` are set to the same value at this point. Import status → `parsed`.
5. The UI polls for status and redirects to `/statements/review/{importId}` on completion.
6. The user can edit transaction details, assign categories, and correct income/expense type. Edits regenerate `hash`; `original_hash` is never touched.
7. On commit, `StatementImportCommitter` creates a `Transaction` for each non-duplicate, non-committed staged row, sets `Transaction.hash = original_hash`, marks staged rows `is_committed = true`, updates import status → `committed`, and deletes the CSV file.

## Deduplication

Hash input: `userId|date|amount|description` (SHA-1).

A transaction is flagged as a duplicate if its hash (or `original_hash`) matches either:
- a `Transaction.hash` in the user's permanent history, or
- a `hash` or `original_hash` on any of the user's `imported_transactions`.

Duplicates are stored and shown in the review UI but excluded from the commit.

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Malformed CSV row | Row skipped, warning logged, processing continues |
| Missing bank profile | Import marked `failed` immediately (non-retriable) |
| Job exception | Retried up to 3 times; `failed()` callback marks import `failed` |
| Re-upload of same file | All transactions flagged duplicate; commit creates no new records |
| Profile deletion conflict | Blocked if profile is used by any import |

## Routes

| Route | Component |
|---|---|
| `/statements/import` | `StatementImportManager` |
| `/statements/bank-profiles` | `BankProfileManager` |
| `/statements/review/{importId}` | `StatementImportReview` |
